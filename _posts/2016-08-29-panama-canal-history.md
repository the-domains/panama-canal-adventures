**Panama Canal History**

In 1534, the King of Spain, Charles V, ordered the first studies for the construction of a canal trough a section of the Isthmus. Altough this idea never materialized, the Spaniards built roads paved with stone that were used to transport, by mules, tons of gold and silver coming from Peru and ound for Spain. Traces of these roads still remain today and can be visited.

In 1880, French companies directed by Ferdinand de Lesseps, the builder of the Suez Canal, began construction of the Panama Canal. But after seven years of fighting diseases and the indomitable problems of the jungle terrain, de Lesseps was forced to abandon the project.

In 1903, the province of Panama declared its independence from Colombia and immediately signed the Hay-Bunau Varilla Treaty which authorized the United States to start construction of the Canal in 1904\. It was completed and started operations on August 15, 1914\.

Today it provides easy transit between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans by a locks system that ascends ships to a lake (one of the largest manmade in the world) and then descends them to the other ocean at about 50 miles on the opposite side.
